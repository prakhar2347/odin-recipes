    <p>Jalebi is a popular Indian sweet known for its spiral shape, crispy texture, and syrupy sweetness. Made by deep-frying fermented batter into coils and then soaking them in sugar syrup, jalebi is often enjoyed hot and fresh during festivals, weddings, or as a special treat with breakfast. Its golden-orange color and sticky exterior make it instantly recognizable, while its rich taste brings joy across all age groups.<p>
